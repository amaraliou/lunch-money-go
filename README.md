# Lunch Money Go

Go Client for the Lunch Money API. [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/) is a multicurrency budgeting tool I use for my personal finances. Sadly though, it doesn't have bank connections to UK banks out of the box. This client is the first piece of a tool I am building to automatically sync my transactions from UK bank accounts into the app several times a day.
